# TTS Java Projects and Labs

## LAB 1 - Part 1
1. Start with a very basic class with main() method and Hello World!
2. Declare two variables in the class:
    - an integer named methodCount 
    - a string varible named className
3. Write two statements to print out the value of each variable.
4. Declare an integer variable inside of the main() method named mainInt. 
5. Using the add-assignment operator, add the value of mainInt to methodCount and print the value of methodCount to ensure the value is correct.
6. Declare a floating point varible inside of the main method and initialize its value to 845.4f.
7. Now declare an integer and try to initilaize it with the value of the floating point variable. 
8. The output of your program should be similar to this:
    ```
    Hello World!
    Method count: 0
    Class Name: null
    Method count: 1
    Float: 845.4, Cast float: 845
    ```
